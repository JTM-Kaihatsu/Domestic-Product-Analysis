# Domestic-Product-Analysis
Using publicly-available data from the Official Statistics Portal of Japan, this project seeks to analyze relationships between various industries and geographic regions. This unlocks the potential to predict industry growth based on domestic migration. 

Initial analysis will be performed in iPython Notebook, then code will be made into separate Python files as the following modules:
- Data extraction and preprocessing
- Overall industry statistics
- Industry by prefecture
- Domestic migration patterns
- Anomaly detection and reporting
- Prefectural labor statistics correlation and regression
- Predicted industry growth by prefecture
